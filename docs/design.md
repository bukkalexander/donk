I want to start small by compiling a python like file with only variables that are int and that can perform addition between two variables. I guess I need to be able to return some value in the c code, but perhaps I start by simply encapsulating procedural code into a main function in c, and then add functions later, since I think I can have the restriction in my language that a main function is needed.
